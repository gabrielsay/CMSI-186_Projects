   didn't handle negative angle argument; throws uncaught NumberFormatException
   didn't handle negative time slice argument; passed through
   didn't handle zero time slice argument; passed through
   didn't handle 360.0 degree angle argument as out of range
   didn't handle 1801.0 time slice argument as out of range

main exists             : works                             -  1 point
works as advertised     : passes all tests in the series    -  4.5 points
   none of the test cases produces any output.  However you DO have code there,
      so I'll only take of 1/2 credit.

Files in Git            : two files required                -  2 points
Coding Style overall    : coding style acceptable           -  1 point
